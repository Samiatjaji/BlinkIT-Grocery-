# Introduction
This is a Power BI project on sales data for a store called BlinkIt. This project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of BlinkIt's sales performance, customer satisfaction and inventory distribution to identify key insights and opportunities for optimisation using various KPIs and visualisations.

Disclaimer: This dataset was gotten from a YouTube tutorial for practice and build a dashboard using PowerBI.

## Problem Statement
KPIs Requirements
- Total Sales
- Average sales
- Number of items
- Average ratings

Charts Requirements 
- Total Sales by Fat content,
- Total Sales by item type
- Fat content by outlet for total sales
- Total sales by outlet establishment 
- Sales by outlet size
- Sales by Outlet Location 
- All metrics by outlet type

## Data Cleaning 
The data cleaning was done in PowerBI where I checked for errors, missing values and filtered where necessary.
I created a new parameter (field) as well named "Metric" to provide more information for the charts.
