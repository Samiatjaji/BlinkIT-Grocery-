## Data Cleaning 
The data cleaning was done in PowerBI where I checked for errors, missing values and filtered where necessary.
I created a new parameter (field) as well named "Metric" to provide more information for the charts.

- Total Sales by Fat content
The chart reveals that "Regular" products ($776.32K)  significantly outsell "Low Fat" products (425.36K). The larger segment of the pie chart representing "Regular" products indicates a higher proportion of sales generated from this category.

- Total Sales by item type


"Fruits & Vegetables" and "Snacks & Beverages" appear to be the top-selling product categories, with significantly higher sales compared to other categories. "Household" is also a strong performer.
Categories like "Seafood," "Breakfast," "Starchy Foods," "Hard Drinks," and "Others" have considerably lower sales compared to the top-performing categories.

- Fat content by outlet for total sales

In all three outlet tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3), "Regular" products have significantly higher sales compared to "Low Fat" products. This suggests a strong preference for regular products across all outlet types. This further supports the earlier visualisation where Total sales of regular products is higher than that of low fat.
However, Tier 3 outlets have the highest sales for both categories, followed by Tier 2 and then Tier 1. This might indicate that larger or higher-end outlets have higher sales volumes overall.

- Total sales by outlet establishment

The chart shows the growth of outlet establishments over time, from 2010 to 2022. There is an upward trend, indicating an increase in the number of outlets over the years. However, the growth is not linear and has experienced fluctuations. There was a significant increase in outlet establishment in 2018 ($205K) which declined again in 2020 (129K).

- Sales by outlet size

The largest segment of the pie chart represents "Medium" outlets, indicating that they contribute the most to overall sales. Specifically, Medium outlets account for $507.90K in sales.
"Small" outlets also contribute significantly to sales, with $444.79K.
"High" outlets have the smallest share of sales, generating $248.99K.

- Sales by Outlet Location

The chart shows that Tier 3 outlets generate the highest sales, followed by Tier 2, and then Tier 1. This suggests that sales performance increases with the tier level of the outlet. There is a considerable difference in sales between different outlet tiers. Tier 3 outlets generate 472.13K, while Tier 1 outlets generate 336.40K, indicating a significant variation in sales performance across different outlet locations.

- All metrics by outlet type

Supermarket Type 1 has the highest total sales ($787.55K) and the number of items sold (5577), indicating that it is the most significant contributor to overall revenue. The number of items sold varies slightly across the other outlet types (Grocery store, Supermarket Type 2 and Supermarket Type 3), but the differences are not substantial. Across all outlet types, the average sales per item and average rating are relatively consistent. The "Item Visibility" metric is almost the same  across all outlet types, suggesting that product get the same visibility in driving  sales.

## Insights
- The data indicates no correlation between outlet size and sales revenue. Medium size generates the highest sales, followed by low and high.
- The fluctuations in outlet establishment suggests that the company may have adjusted its growth strategy over time, adapting to changing market conditions and business objectives.

- Across all outlet types, the average sales per item and average rating are relatively consistent. This suggests a consistent level of customer satisfaction and pricing across different outlet types.

## Recommendations 

- The company should continue to focus on the demand for regular products while also exploring strategies to increase sales of low fat products especially in Medium outlets.
- While the customer base prefers regular products, the company should however also cater to the growing demand for healthier options by offering a wider range of low fat and healthy choices.
- The company should focus on expanding its offerings and marketing efforts in the top selling categories like fruits and vegetables to capitalise on their popularity.
- Inventory levels should be optimised to ensure sufficient stock of high demand products while minimising inventory costs for low performing categories.
